# TopicSearch Component

This project is a simple React component that displays a list of topics and allows the user to filter them by search input. It simulates the browsing UI for a Catalogue Management System.

## Features

- **Search Input:** Filters topics by name, case-insensitive, as the user types.
- **Topic Cards:** Displays the name, category, and description of topics.
- **No Results Handling:** Shows a message when no topics match the search.
- **Simple UI Design:** Uses clean styling with hover effects on both the search bar and topic cards.
